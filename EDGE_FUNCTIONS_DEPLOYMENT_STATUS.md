# Edge Functions Deployment Status

## ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETE

All edge function code has been fixed and is ready for deployment to Supabase.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. CORS Configuration
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
- **File:** `activity-progress-generator/index.ts`
- **Issue:** CORS preflight was not handling OPTIONS correctly
- **Solution:** Simplified OPTIONS handler to return 204 status with corsHeaders
- **Result:** All responses now use consistent CORS headers from shared module

### 2. Supabase Import Errors
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
- **Issue:** `npm:` prefix doesn't work in Deno edge runtime for dynamic imports
- **Solution:** Changed all imports to use `https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2.54.0`

**Files Updated:**
1. ✅ `activity-progress-generator/index.ts` - Changed from static to dynamic import
2. ✅ `wearable-sync/index.ts` (line 37)
3. ✅ `enrich-activity-wearable/index.ts` (line 34)
4. ✅ `wearable-oauth-callback/index.ts` (line 89)
5. ✅ `process-enrichment-queue/index.ts` (line 39)

## Functions Ready for Deployment

### Critical Priority (Deploy First)
1. **activity-progress-generator** - AI-powered activity insights
   - ✅ CORS fixed
   - ✅ Import fixed (dynamic esm.sh)
   - Status: Ready for deployment

2. **wearable-sync** - Wearable data synchronization
   - ✅ Import fixed (dynamic esm.sh)
   - Status: Ready for deployment

3. **enrich-activity-wearable** - Activity enrichment with biometric data
   - ✅ Import fixed (dynamic esm.sh)
   - Status: Ready for deployment

4. **wearable-oauth-callback** - OAuth callback handler
   - ✅ Import fixed (dynamic esm.sh)
   - Status: Ready for deployment

5. **process-enrichment-queue** - Background queue processor
   - ✅ Import fixed (dynamic esm.sh)
   - Status: Ready for deployment

## Deployment Commands

Deploy all fixed functions at once:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/project

# Deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy activity-progress-generator
supabase functions deploy wearable-sync
supabase functions deploy enrich-activity-wearable
supabase functions deploy wearable-oauth-callback
supabase functions deploy process-enrichment-queue
```

Or deploy all at once:
```bash
supabase functions deploy
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Activity Insights Tab
- ✅ CORS errors will disappear
- ✅ AI-powered insights will work
- ✅ "Mode Analyse Locale" banner will disappear
- ✅ OpenAI analysis will generate personalized recommendations

### Wearable Sync
- ✅ Device connection will work end-to-end
- ✅ Data synchronization will complete successfully
- ✅ Activity enrichment with biometric data will function
- ✅ Background queue processing will enrich activities automatically

### Progression Tab
- ✅ AI-powered progression analysis will work
- ✅ Advanced charts and insights will be available

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Activity Insights:**
   - Navigate to Activity → Insights
   - Verify no CORS errors in console
   - Check for AI-generated insights (not local fallback)
   - Confirm banner says AI mode, not "Mode Analyse Locale"

2. **Wearable Sync:**
   - Navigate to Settings → Connected Devices
   - Connect a wearable device (Strava, Garmin, etc.)
   - Click "Sync Now"
   - Verify sync completes without errors
   - Check that activities show biometric data (heart rate, etc.)

3. **Activity Enrichment:**
   - Create a new manual activity
   - Verify it automatically enriches with wearable data if available
   - Check that enrichment happens within 30 seconds

## Build Verification

Frontend build completed successfully:
```
✓ 4411 modules transformed
Build completed successfully
```

All edge function code has been verified and is ready for deployment.

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Deploy the edge functions** using the commands above
2. ⏳ **Test thoroughly** using the testing checklist
3. ⏳ **Monitor logs** for any issues: `supabase functions logs <function-name> --tail`
4. ⏳ **Verify costs** are within expected ranges in `ai_analysis_jobs` table

## Important Notes

- All code fixes are complete in local files
- Functions are NOT yet deployed to live Supabase instance
- Current production functions still have the old code with issues
- Fallback systems are working correctly until deployment
- No breaking changes - fallback will continue to work if deployment fails

## Cost Monitoring

After deployment, monitor AI analysis costs:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as analyses,
  SUM((result_payload->>'costUsd')::numeric) as total_cost
FROM ai_analysis_jobs
WHERE analysis_type = 'trend_analysis'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

Expected cost per analysis: $0.01-0.05 (using GPT-5-mini)
